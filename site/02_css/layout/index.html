    <h1>CSS Layout</h1>

<p>Layout is the process of determining where to position each piece of content in 2-dimensional space.
You may be familiar with this concept from desktop publishing tools such as Adobe InDesign, or its predecessor Pagemaker.
Or even from the pre-digital printing practice utilizing columns of text, called galleys, which are then cut to length and pasted up on a grid along with photos and illustrations.</p>

<p>CSS layout borrows from this long history of page layout in graphic design.
However, layouts for the web need to be more flexible than those for physical media.
In a typical desktop publishing process, the designer has the content available, and also knows
the size of the pages that are being printed.
If one of these changes, the designer will go through the layouts and update so that the content fits on the pages.</p>

<p>When designing layouts for the web, however, the designer often doesn't have the content, because it hasn't been generated yet.
The output medium is also variable, as the resulting layout will be viewed on many different devices, at different sizes and resolutions.
Users may also have configured their devices to their own preferences, such as font size or scale factor.</p>

<p>If web pages were rendered at a fixed size like pages of a physical book, they could still be legible, but much more difficult to consume.
This is the situation we encounter when documents are preformatted as PDF.
The pages of a PDF file are usually intended for printing on one of the standard paper sizes.
It can be previewed on a screen, and if that screen is large enough and has adequate resolution, this
screen view may be an acceptable reading experience.
But view that same file on a mobile phone, tablet, or even most laptop computers, and users will have to
zoom out to see the entire page, and zoom in to make the text legible.
When zoomed in, they will have to scroll or drag the page up/down and left/right to access all of the content.
This is not an acceptable reading experience.
And if the content is something that the user needs to interact with, it quickly becomes unworkable.</p>

<p>Since pre-formatted pages are unacceptable, web layout must be deferred until both the full content,
and the target screen characteristics are known.
This means the actual formatting has to take place in the browser.
It also means that any layout instructions we give to the browser cannot be overly specific.
In essence, CSS layout is about providing constraints, hints, and strategies, which the browser
then applies as needed to present the content on each specific device configuration.</p>

<p>There is a very general strategy, built into every browser, which is applied when no CSS layout has been given.
It starts by assuming that the content has been properly marked up in HTML.
The markup is used to divide the content into <code data-mark-around="`">block</code> elements and <code data-mark-around="`">inline</code> elements.
Block elements are larger pieces of content like paragraphs, headings, figures, tables, and lists.
Inline elements are shorter strings of characters such as links, quotations, emphasized phrases, and (strangely) images.
Block elements may contain inline elements, other block elements, or both.
Inline elements may only contain other inline elements.</p>

<p>Once the content is divided into block and inline elements, the layout strategy proceeds as follows:</p>

<ul><undefined></undefined>
</ul>

    <h2>Box Model</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we saw that padding adds space inside was inserted inside</p>

<p>The <code data-mark-around="`">content-box</code> and <code data-mark-around="`">border-box</code> classes use the properties <code data-mark-around="`">height</code>, <code data-mark-around="`">width</code>, <code data-mark-around="`">padding</code>, and <code data-mark-around="`">border</code>, to describe the layout of these boxes.
The difference between the two boxes is the <code data-mark-around="`">box-sizing</code> properties,
which determines how the overall dimensions of the box are computed from the other properties.</p>

<h3>The <code data-mark-around="`">width</code> property</h3>

<p>Every box in CSS has a width.
Often there is no need to set the width since the browser will automatically determine a width based on the box's content and other properties.</p>

<p>But we can also control the width by setting the <code data-mark-around="`">width</code> property directly.
We can either specify a length, a percentage, or one of several keywords, including the default, <code data-mark-around="`">auto</code>.
Here we specify a length in pixels.</p>

<p>This is called an <em data-mark-around="_">extrinsic</em> width, because it has nothing to do with the contents of the element.
We will see soon how to set an <em data-mark-around="_">intrinsic</em> width, which accounts for the box's contents.</p>

<h3>The <code data-mark-around="`">height</code> property</h3>

<p>Analogous to <code data-mark-around="`">width</code>, the <code data-mark-around="`">height</code> property determines how tall the box is.</p>

<p>Setting <code data-mark-around="`">height</code> to a fixed value, instead of the default <code data-mark-around="`">auto</code>, leads to the potential of content overflowing the box, and the need to handle scrolling, or truncated content. So it tends to be less common to set the <code data-mark-around="`">height</code> than the <code data-mark-around="`">width</code>.</p>

<h3>The <code data-mark-around="`">border</code> property</h3>

<p>We've seen the <code data-mark-around="`">border</code> property before, when we discussed colors. The <code data-mark-around="`">border</code> property is actually a shorthand for the properties <code data-mark-around="`">border-color</code>, <code data-mark-around="`">border-style</code>, and <code data-mark-around="`">border-width</code>.
In this discussion we'll be concerned with the <code data-mark-around="`">border-width</code>, which sets the width, or <em data-mark-around="_">thickness</em>, of the border. Here we've specified that the border be 4 pixels thick.</p>

<h3>The <code data-mark-around="`">padding</code> property</h3>

<p>Because we often want some whitespace between a box's border and its content,
the box model allows us to set the dimensions of the <code data-mark-around="`">padding</code>. Here we've specified the same padding,
20 pixels, in all directions.
It is also possible to use the <code data-mark-around="`">padding</code> property to set different dimensions for horizontal and vertical padding, or even to specify a different amount of padding in each direction.</p>

    <h2>The <code data-mark-around="`">box-sizing</code> property</h2>

&lt;&gt;&lt;p class="content-box"&gt;
  This is a paragraph of content. We've put a box with a border around it.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;&gt;&lt;p class="border-box"&gt;
  Here is a box with a border around it. We've put this content inside.
&lt;/p&gt;
```


<p>Every web page is laid out by putting content into boxes, and positioning
those boxes relative to each other. So the basic model for layout is
the box model.</p>

<figure><figcaption>css</figcaption><pre lang="css"><code>.content-box {
  width: 200px;
  height: auto; /* default */
  border: 4px solid #cec;
  padding: 20px;
  /* this was the default, prior to reset: */
  box-sizing: content-box;
}

.border-box {
  width: 200px;
  height: auto; /* default */
  border: 4px solid #cce;
  padding: 20px;
}

</code></pre></figure>

<p>By default, the <code data-mark-around="`">width</code> property refers to the width of the box's <em data-mark-around="_">content</em>, exclusive of the padding and border.
Sometimes this is what you want, but at other times, we want to make this box fit into a larger layout,
and it would be easier for us to specify the overall width of the box, including padding and borders.
In fact, before CSS was standardized, that is exactly how some browsers (notably Internet Explorer) interpreted <code data-mark-around="`">width</code>. This was called <em data-mark-around="_">Quirks mode</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS standardized the definition of the <code data-mark-around="`">width</code> property, it would've been very difficult to
convert the large amounts of CSS that were written assuming <em data-mark-around="_">Quirks mode</em>'s box model.
So another property, <code data-mark-around="`">box-sizing</code> was added to provide support for three box models: <code data-mark-around="`">content-box</code> (the default), <code data-mark-around="`">border-box</code> (the Quirks mode one), and <code data-mark-around="`">padding-box</code> (which considers everything inside the border part of the width).</p>

<p>Even though the default is <code data-mark-around="`">content-box</code>, many developers still prefer <code data-mark-around="`">border-box</code>, and end up
"resetting" the default <code data-mark-around="`">box-sizing</code> to <code data-mark-around="`">border-box</code>. In the following discussion, we will assume this reset has been applied to the CSS.</p>

<figure><figcaption>css</figcaption><pre lang="css"><code>* {
  /* reset the box model to use border-box */
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre></figure>

<h2>Dealing with Overflow</h2>

<p>When designing layouts, we should always consider the content that is being presented.
In some cases, the content is static.
We know what it contains and it will never change.
But often the same layout is used to contain different content at different times.
For example, the same layout may be used to present all the articles on a news site.</p>

<p>Designers often work with placeholder text when working with content that is unknown or subject to change.
But we also need to anticipate what will happen when some unusual text occurs.</p>
